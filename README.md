# Craft Unique Value

A fieldtype for Craft that will force the contents to be unique across all instances of that field.


### Todo someday

- Provide AJAX validation from the field itself
- Give the user the option to select a modified string that is actually unique
- Add field setting to switch whether field is unique to all instances or Section
